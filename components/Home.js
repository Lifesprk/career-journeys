    <h1>Career Journeys</h1>
    <p>
      At Gloo we believe that every person is on a journey of growth within their life. This journey is multi-faceted and spans every aspect of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is at the core of what Gloo is about and, as such, we are called to ensure that we are supporting every employee on their personal and
      professional growth journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document should serve as your guide as you approach professional, career and personal growth as part of the Gloo engineering team.
      It not only serves as a framework that you may apply to your whole career, but also will give you a practical understanding of how to progress
      here at Gloo and how your progression will affect your compensation, title and the expectations that your team will have of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that we treat this framework as a guide, not a rulebook or checklist.  We should take a common sense approach and use this to
      enable meaningful conversations between you and your manager.
